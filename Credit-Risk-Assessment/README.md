**Insights**
- Unemployed borrowers have a higher default rate than salaried employees. - Full-time employees are at a lower risk of default.

### Data Preprocessing

- **Class Imbalance Handling:**  
  - I addressed class imbalance using **SMOTE** to oversample the minority class and experimented with **class weighting** in model training.  

- **Feature Engineering:**  
  - Categorical variables were encoded using **One-Hot Encoding (OHE)** and **Label Encoding** where appropriate.  
  - Numerical features were scaled using **StandardScaler** to ensure consistency across different models.
  - Missing values were handled by dropping the rows with missing values, since the percentage of missing data was negligible. 

## 6. Model Development  

- **Baseline Models:**  
  - I started with **Logistic Regression** to establish a simple benchmark. 

- **Advanced Models:**  
  - **Random Forest** helped improve predictive performance through ensemble learning.  
  - **XGBoost** was implemented to leverage boosting for higher accuracy and recall.  

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
  - I used **RandomizedSearchCV** and **GridSearchCV** to fine-tune key hyperparameters for each model.  

- **Model Evaluation:**  
  - I compared models based on **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC**.  
  - Since class imbalance was a concern, I paid close attention to **recall and F1-score** to ensure the minority class was well predicted.

### Summary Performance 

| Model        | Accuracy | Precision (Defaulters) | Recall (Defaulters) | F1-score (Defaulters) |
|-------------|----------|-----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Logistic Regression** | 72% | 0.22 | 0.56 | 0.32 |
| **Random Forest** | 70% | 0.22 | 0.63 | 0.33 |
| **XGBoost** | 69% | 0.22 | 0.64 | 0.33 |
| **XGBoost Tuned** | 85% | 0.34 | 0.29 | 0.31 |

### Summary of Observations  

#### Accuracy:  
- **XGBoost Tuned** has the highest accuracy at **85%**, significantly outperforming the other models (which range between **69%-72%**).  
- However, since the **dataset is imbalanced**, accuracy alone is not a reliable metric for defaulter detection.  

#### Precision (Defaulters):  
- Precision measures how many of the predicted defaulters are actually defaulters.  
- All models (except **XGBoost Tuned**) have a **low precision of 0.22**, meaning many false positives.  
- **XGBoost Tuned improves precision to 0.34**, which is better at reducing false alarms but may miss actual defaulters.  

#### Recall (Defaulters):  
- Recall is crucial for defaulter detection as it shows how many actual defaulters are correctly identified.  
- **XGBoost (0.64) and Random Forest (0.63) have the highest recall**, meaning they detect more defaulters but at the cost of more false positives.  
- **XGBoost Tuned has the lowest recall (0.29)**, meaning it misses many actual defaulters.  

#### F1-Score (Defaulters):  
- **F1-score balances precision and recall.**  
- **Logistic Regression (0.32), Random Forest (0.33), and XGBoost (0.33)** have similar F1-scores.  
- **XGBoost Tuned (0.31) has a slightly lower F1-score**, indicating an imbalanced trade-off between precision and recall.  

#### Best Model for Detecting Defaulters:  
- **XGBoost is the best choice** due to its **highest recall (0.64)**, ensuring more defaulters are correctly identified.  
- **Random Forest is a close alternative**, with **recall (0.63)** and a similar F1-score (0.33).  
- **XGBoost Tuned sacrifices recall (0.29) for better precision (0.34)** but misses too many defaulters, making it less suitable for this objective.  

#### Conclusion:  
Since the goal is to **detect the highest number of defaulters**, **XGBoost is the best model** due to its **high recall (0.64)**, ensuring more defaulters are correctly identified.
