        "- This suggests **strong business performance** with minor fluctuations.\n",
        "- The small decline in 2023 might indicate external economic factors, operational inefficiencies, or increased costs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Net Income Trend**\n",
        "- Net income remains **relatively stable** compared to revenue, showing only slight variations.\n",
        "- This suggests that **profitability is consistent** despite revenue changes.\n",
        "- The gap between revenue and net income indicates that **operating expenses, taxes, or other costs** play a significant role in determining net profit.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Revenue vs. Net Income Scale Difference**\n",
        "- Revenue is **significantly higher** than net income.\n",
        "- This highlights that while the company generates **high revenue**, profitability is only a **fraction** of that.\n",
        "- The trend could be influenced by factors like **cost of goods sold (COGS), operating expenses, and investments in growth**.\n",
